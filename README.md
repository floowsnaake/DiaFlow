Diablo II Median XL bot work in progess i upload here to keep track/organize my files


current thing the bot can do the fallowing:


Works:
------

* Picks up, Runes,Prefect gems/skull,uniqe items,flawless gems/skull | its buggy someitimes misses things
* Auto opens Teleport when game/kill is over/done.
* Auto messages/says game info in chat when leaves the game.
* logs info to a file.
* shows info in listview.
* reads info from settings file.
* Scripts within the bot so you can customize your own scripts/edit your runs
* use skills


Todo:
------
* read like a ini file. - now got a working ini file but some keys are not enabled/work
* more scripts to do more famring places - external script support is now working but buggy
* Teleport to pick up loot instead of walking to the loot/it sometimes misses the loot becuses it cant walk direcrtly to it.
* add jewels to the loot filter
* make the loot filter easier to edit
* make the loot filter better by fine tuning the loot it pick up
* auto cube gems and runes as an option

buggs:
------
* improve the loot filter
* still a problem with the correct loot not showing up in the status/logg files but it pick up the loot
